This crane model requires some string, which is not included in your kit, but most types of string should work including fishing line. Two motors are used to power winches that pull two string lines to operate the boom (arm) angle and the hoist (hook height), and a third motor rotates the entire crane around in a circle on its base. <br>
Using the remote control program, you can reach loads close to or far from the crane, lift them, pivot the crane around, and place the load somewhere else. Normally construction cranes have another person on the ground to help hook and unhook the load, and you can do this manually if you want, but with some practice you can also do it entirely with the crane controls.

<b>Crane RC </b>
<br>
This remote control program controls the crane with two sliders and two buttons: <br>

* The vertical slider powers the hoist winch to control the hook height. <br>

* The horizontal slider powers the turntable motor to pivot the entire crane around in a circle. <br>

* The F and C buttons control the boom (arm) angle to raise it up and down, which allows you to reach loads that are farther (F) or closer (C) to the crane. The hoist height is also automatically adjused to keep the hook height from changing too much while you adjust the boom. <br>

Be careful not to run the two winch motors past their physical limits, because a winch creates a lot of force and will evenually bend the parts or pull them apart if you go too far. The program contains some code to try to detect when a motor is straining because of a winch that went too far and shut it down before too much damage results.
